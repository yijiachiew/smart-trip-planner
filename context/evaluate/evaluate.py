📈 Section 4: Systematic Evaluation

Regression testing is the practice of re-running existing tests to ensure that new changes haven't broken previously working functionality.

ADK provides two methods to do automatic regression and batch testing: using pytest and the adk eval CLI command. In this section, we'll use the CLI command. For more information on the pytest approach, refer to the links in the resource section at the end of this notebook.

The following image shows the overall process of evaluation. At a high-level, there are four steps to evaluate:

    Create an evaluation configuration - define metrics or what you want to measure
    Create test cases - sample test cases to compare against
    Run the agent with test query
    Compare the results
